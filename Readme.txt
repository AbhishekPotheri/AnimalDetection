Animal Detection - Abhishek Potheri
The project is based on several animal attacks on the field.
The project is designed in opencv where we use install 3 to 4 cameras for a farm land of 2-3 acres. 
The alogrithm is constructed such a manner that the motion in its visual is noticed by the system and continously verified.
The motion is highlighted and distance is calculated by previous set focal length of the camera .
The motion is judged various number of times determing the size and distance of the object from the camera.
Once the motion enter the prone zone (less than 25.00m) from the field signals are distributed to other section and sound producers are excited.
The motion is then regularly monitored and once the motion comes in the most prone zone (lessthan 5.00 to 7.50m) the sound producers are given
command to start producing ultrasonic voice for 10 minutes till the motion in frame clears out.


This project is based on cultivation done in Kerala. Where the frequent attackers are elephant , monkeys and wild boar
in the regions of Munnar, idukki,Wayand ,Pathnamthitta and Malappuram. The above mentioned regions remote areas where connection to
electricity is limited and cost is too high to earn them a sufficient profit.
 Thus introducing a new method with Computer Vision Alogrithm to detect animals with help of low cost cameras and ordinary workstation at their field.

This method ensures harmless methods towards wildlife and save money on a large scale .
The traditional method electrified Fencing which have to be installed and monthly expense is pretty high. Thus adopting this method ensures more profit
and attracts many to this field.
Using PIR sensors can ensure the same effect but it does decrease the accuracy to a certain amount.
Animals are not adjustale to these high decibel sound that they tend to avoid visiting these area to some extent of time.Thus ensure mitigation as well.


Thus the problem was detected, prvention and mitigation steps are installed.
